## Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How To Play
Memory Game will start upon clicking the first card.  Once a card is clicked it will flip over revealing the card type.  Once two cards are flipped over the card types are compared.  If they are the same type they will turn green indicating a match and will stay flipped over.  If they are not the same type they will flash red indicating no match and after a few moments will flip back over. Each time two cards are compared this is counted as a move.  The number of moves determines the score of the game in terms of gold stars.  When all cards are matched you will receive a congratulations message displaying how long the game took and your star score.  The game will reset after closing the congratulations window.
